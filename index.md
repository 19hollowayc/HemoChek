### How does HemoChek save lives?

Doctors spend alot of time checking for hypercoagulation through constantly checking a patient's blood levels. Due to COVID-19 more doctors and patients are cathching COVID-19 because of this. While doctor's can not check a patient's blood level due to the increase of patients they are monitoring. Through our app doctors can now check the blood levels through HemoChek.
